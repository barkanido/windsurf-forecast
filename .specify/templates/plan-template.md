# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with constitution principles from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [ ] **Provider Architecture Pattern**: If adding weather providers, follows trait-based architecture with ForecastProvider implementation
- [ ] **Explicit Unit Handling**: New measurements document units clearly; unit conversions are provider-specific and documented
- [ ] **Timezone Standardization**: Timestamps use UTC internally, convert to Asia/Jerusalem for output via custom serializer
- [ ] **Hard-Coded Configuration**: Location coordinates remain at 32.486722, 34.888722; date range constraint ≤ 7 days enforced
- [ ] **Error Transparency**: Error messages are actionable and guide users to resolution
- [ ] **Testing Workflow**: Code changes follow iterative workflow (cargo check → build → clippy → run, with --release only for final validation)
- [ ] **Provider Extension Protocol**: If adding provider, all 7 registration steps completed (see ADDING_PROVIDERS.md)
- [ ] **CLI-First Development**: All functionality exposed via command-line interface with `--help` support
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Environment variables managed via .env file; unique var names per provider

*Note: Check "Complexity Justification" section if any violations need justification.*

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
